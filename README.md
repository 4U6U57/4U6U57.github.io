# Website (depreciated)
This repo archives several versions of my personal website. It was
renamed from [4U6U57.github.io]
(http://github.com/4U6U57/4U6U57.github.io) to make room for a new 
website repo forked from an existing framework.

This site can still be accessed at 
[4U6U57.github.io/website-depreciated]
(4U6U57.github.io/website-depreciated).

## Branches
Each branch in this repo reflects an iteration of the site. Below are
some human readable descriptions for each version

- *version-polymer-card*: The first iteration of the site, and my first
experience using Polymer paper elements and Bower.
- *version-polymer-drawer*: Changing the basic layout to incorporate 
multiple "views" using a drawer (sidebar)
- *version-polymer-master*: The most complex layout, with multiple
subpages, each with their own distinct layout
- *version-angular-master*: Switching from Polymer to Angular Material
and AngularJS. Most resources pulled in from CDNs, including the actual
site content, which is hosted on Firebase.
